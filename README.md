# Animal Chess
 Animal Chess is a two player strategy game. The Animal Chess gameboard represents a jungle terrain with dens, traps "set" around dens, and rivers. Each player controls eight game pieces representing different animals of various rank. Stronger-ranked animals can capture ("eat") animals of weaker or equal rank. The player who is first to maneuver any one of their pieces into the opponent's den wins the game. An alternative way to win is to capture all the opponent's pieces.
